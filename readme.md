# TF2 (PLEASE READ AUTOEXECS)

## How to install

This is meant to be used with mastercomfig, if you don't have it, add `+exec overrides/autoexec` to your launch options in steam

1. Download [here](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/xamionex/Configs/tree/main/Team%20Fortress%202)
2. Locate TF2 location\
3. Go into Team Fortress 2/tf/cfg/\
4. Extract the zip into the folder (using 7zip)\
5. IF Ingame: run `exec overrides/autoexec` in console
   - If console is disabled either:
     - go into options > controls > advanced > enable developer console, then open it with ~
     - restart the game

## Customizing

Adding a settings.cfg file next to autoexec will be used after all the cfgs from my config

### A lot of the things in this cfg are explained inside there, here are some previews though
